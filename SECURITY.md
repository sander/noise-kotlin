# Security policy

> **Warning**: Do not use this code in production. Expect vulnerabilities. See the [README](README.md) for details.

## Supported versions

Currently only pre-release and snapshot versions are available. Any vulnerability should be mitigated in a next pre-release version.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Report vulnerabilities to [Sander](mailto:mail@sanderdijkhuis.nl) in private, mentioning the project name in the mail subject header. Indicate if and how you want to be identified when publishing about the vulnerability. Expect to get a response within 7 days, but usually within 48 hours, indicating whether the report is accepted. I make my best effort to share fixes for vulnerabilities and publish about the reports when appropriate.
