# Security policy

## Supported versions

Currently only the latest (pre-)release version is maintained. Any vulnerability should be mitigated in a next pre-release version.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Report vulnerabilities to [Sander](mailto:mail@sanderdijkhuis.nl) in private, mentioning the project name in the mail subject header. Indicate if and how you want to be identified when publishing about the vulnerability. Expect to get a response within 7 days, but usually within 48 hours, indicating whether the report is accepted. I make my best effort to share fixes for vulnerabilities and publish about the reports when appropriate.
